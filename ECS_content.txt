"Parents call it talking back but we call it explaining". In the end it is all about our own perspective. The problems that we came to know about generation gap our far from just ordinary and have implications in every aspect of our society from homes to the industry everywhere.
For this happens due to this change of generation. For this no one solely responsible. This can be decreased by little compromise of both.
Every generation needs its regeneration. It is the duty of the younger ones to just not ignore their history but rather they should respect their old traditions and try to revive them in order to fill the gap.Someone might state,"What intellectual property, knowledge and know-how is walking out the door when traditionalists and baby boomers retire?
The answer was in the question itself that it is their intellect and knowledge that is going out is their loss and therefore they must be their prized possession and should go hand in hand with them and probably also just share with them the social media too.
